# The company All In One Place

The company All in One Place is a Multibrand Outlet company, that is, it sells second-line products of several brands at a lower price, through an e-commerce.

In just over 1 year of operation, the marketing team realized that some customers in its base buy more expensive products with high frequency and end up contributing with a significant portion of the company's revenue.

Based on this perception, the marketing team will launch a loyalty program for the best customers in the base, called Insiders. But the team does not have an advanced knowledge of data analysis to elect program participants.

For this reason, the marketing team asked the data team to select eligible customers for the program, using advanced data manipulation techniques.

# Business Problem

In possession of this list, the Marketing team will carry out a sequence of personalized and exclusive actions to the group, in order to increase sales and purchase frequency.

As a result of this project, you are expected to submit a list of people eligible to participate in the Insiders program, along with a report answering the following questions:
